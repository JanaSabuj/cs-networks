# TCP vs UDP

| TCP | UDP |
| :--- | :--- |
| It is a **connection oritented** protocol | It is a **connection less** protocol |
| Reliable as it provides **error checking support** and also **guarantees delivery** of messages to the receiver | Non-reliable because it does only **basic error checking with checksum** and **no guarantee** of message delivery |
